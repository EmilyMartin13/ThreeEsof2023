            <h3> I love this photo, Ethan is clearly relieved and I am ecstatic. </h3>
            <p> Ethan proposed in my hometown Drumheller at my favourite lookour point, Horsethief canyon.
                Growning up I always went here to watch sunsets and I could not have asked for a more perfect spot.

                We had drove to Drumheller that day and Ethan asked me if I wanted to watch the sunset
                later and I agreed. After supper we went and walked up one of the ridges. I hugged Ethan and
                his heart was pounding. Then and there he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.

                We got back to the main hill and a stranger walked up to us and said that she was taking pictures of
                the sunset and then saw us getting engaged and captured the moment. Thus, the incredible photo we have
                of our engagement.
